    <p>As a conservative member of our community, I am committed to the safety and well-being of our neighborhood. My approach goes beyond professional service to build relationships that protect and serve our shared values.</p>
    <p><strong>Supporting First Responders</strong><br>I am proud to offer special discounts for active-duty military, veterans, first responders, and law enforcement personnel. Itâ€™s my way of giving back to those who protect us every day.</p>
